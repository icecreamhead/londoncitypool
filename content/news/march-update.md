summary: Our new constitution, AGM, Summer League and Knockout tournaments latest
---

As we are now into the home stretch of the standard league season, the Committee thought it would be an appropriate time to provide an update on what is in store over the coming months, and how things are generally shaping up in the league.
## Constitution
We have discovered this year that there are a few things in the way that we work that have all always taken for granted, and haven't been formalised. This has led to a few issues during running the league this year. To try to cover this off, we have written a League Constitution, which everyone can access from the [constitution](/admin/constitution/) page.\
This shouldn't cover anything that we don't already do - it just captures it for all to see. As with all league matters, this is open to change through a voting process at a league meeting. Therefore, if you want to suggest any amends, you can do so via the League Secretary and the next AGM.
## Summer League
We plan to hold a new tournament during the summer months, where traditionally we have not had any competitive pool. This will allow us to try out new rules and formats, whilst also keeping our cueing arms ticking over.\
Due to people traditionally having less availability over the summer, team sizes will be smaller (3 players), with squads to accommodate individuals holiday plans.\
We're also going to try out fixed venue, fixed nights of the week and International rules - to see how that goes down with everyone.\
More details will be on the way in late April for people to enter. For the moment, the proposed format and rules are now available on the [summer league](/admin/summer-rules/) section of the site.

## AGM Date
In order to provide the Committee with time to schedule the new 'winter' league season in October, attract new teams, and factor in any format changes from the AGM; we have decided to move the AGM earlier in the year. It will now be held at the midpoint of the summer league season. \
Therefore, please pencil in **Wednesday 26th July** at Hurricane Room to your diary.\
Another reason for holding the AGM at this time, is to allow more teams to have representatives at the meeting. We cannot make decisions about the running of the league without everyone's input. Also, we cannot continue to have such low attendance as we have seen in previous years. A formal invitation and announcement will come in due course - but be aware that we expect all teams expecting to play in the 'winter' league season to be present.\
Of course, we will also open suggestions for rule changes, and also nominations for election to Committee positions closer to the time.

## Knockout Tournaments
We are now approaching the final stages of the KO tournaments. Finals night is due to happen on Wednesday 17th May - subject to venue and player availability. Our congratulations go to the following players for making it this far:

[Singles Final](/ko/singles/):\
Nick Phillips v Tom Haworth

[Doubles Semi Finals](/ko/doubles/):\
Rich Phillips/Omeed Starmer v Jon Ferris/Greg Kolokouris\
Nick Phillips/Rupert Ward v Dengkai Lao/Joven Liang
